# Janus-Examples
Simple samples for MeetEcho's Janus WebRtc Server

The philosophy behind these samples is to provide concise examples that demonstrate how to use the Janus WebRtc server.  

These examples are meant to be as stripped-down as possible.  
The sample on MeetEcho's website attempt to show off every feature that is available. As a result they are difficult to read and decipher for beginning Janus programmers.  

Whenever possible I try to keep all the code for an excample in a single file, and I avoid any third-party libraries. I use basic HTML and Javascript to demonstrate one or two basic features.
